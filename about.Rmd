# At UW: 
The Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management program at the UW is providing me with the mathematical, statistical, data science, and optimization skills to thrive in my research. Using mathematical models, my goal for my graduate research is to better inform invasive species management.

# Current Projects:
1. Reviewing different spatio-temporal models that are used in invasive species management. 
2. Understanding how different monitoring data streams can influence management outcomes for an invasive species. Case Study: Rusty Crayfish in John Day River, Oregon


# Before coming to UW: 
I received my bachelorâ€™s at Houghton College in Western New York, I majored in mathematics and minored in biology and education while playing Division III soccer. After taking upper level applied math courses, I found my niche in mathematical ecology and started to immerse myself in research. During my sophomore year, I was involved in a summer research project that mathematically modeled the optimal growth strategy of the northern pitcher plant, a carnivorous plant, in various nitrogen environments. During my junior year, I completed summer research at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis at the University of Tennessee with Dr. Suzanne Lenhart and Dr. Charles Sims and built a feral cat population model that incorporated the economic costs associated with possible management strategies to give guidance about policy decisions (see news link [here](http://www.nimbios.org/sre/kwarta_sre2018) ). Throughout my final semester, I studied antipredator responses of the Northern dusky salamander in a lab setting. Upon graduating in December 2018, I accepted an internship at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to work on a project that used satellite imagery and geospatial techniques to identify potential natural land corridors in East Tennessee to facilitate safe movement of black bears across a landscape to alleviate the problem of land fragmentation (news link [here](https://orise.orau.gov/ornl/experiences/recent-bachelors-associates/kwarta.html) )
