# Welcome !

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Missouri Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit at the University of Missouri -I heard the cool kids call it Mizzou. I currently work with [Dr. Craig Paukert](http://www.riverstudies.com/) (Mizzou) and [Dr. Mike Colvin](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/mike-colvin) (USGS) to apply quantitative population models and decision analysis tools to better inform invasive carp management in North America.

### Education:
* Ph.D. in Quantitative ecology and Resource Management (QERM), June 2024
  + Co-advised by [Dr. Julian Olden](http://depts.washington.edu/oldenlab/) and [Dr. Sarah Converse](http://depts.washington.edu/qcons/).
* B.A. in Mathematics (minors: Biology, Education) Houghton College, December 2018

### Research interests:
* Quantitative ecology
* Invasive species management
* Decision analysis (Structured Decision Making, adaptive management)
* Game theory applications to natural resource management
* Bayesian statistics
